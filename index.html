                    <p>Before: The roof was old, worn, and leaking, causing water damage to the interior of the house.
                        <br>After: Following our work, the new roof is sturdy, weather-resistant, and aesthetically pleasing, providing optimal protection and improving the overall appearance of the home.</p>

                        detracting from the curb appeal and insulation of the house.
                    <br>After: Thanks to us, the new siding is fresh, durable, and
                     enhances the energy efficiency and visual appeal of the home,
                     giving it a rejuvenated look.</p>

                    causing water to overflow and damage the foundation of the house.
                    <br>After: Following the gutter replacement by the company, 
                    the new gutters efficiently channel rainwater away from the home,
                     preventing flooding and preserving the structural integrity of the property.</p>

                        <p>I recently had Crockett Construction replace my old, leaky roof, and I couldn't be happier with the results! From start to finish, their team was professional, courteous, and efficient. The crew arrived on time, worked diligently, and cleaned up thoroughly after themselves. The new roof looks fantastic and has held up perfectly through some recent storms. I highly recommend Crockett Construction for anyone in need of roofing services. Thank you for a job well done!</p>

The team was punctual, knowledgeable, and worked tirelessly to get the job done efficiently. They paid attention to every detail and ensured that the siding was installed flawlessly. The house looks brand new, and I've received numerous compliments from my neighbors already. Crockett Construction exceeded my expectations, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone needing siding work. Thanks for a job well done!</p>
